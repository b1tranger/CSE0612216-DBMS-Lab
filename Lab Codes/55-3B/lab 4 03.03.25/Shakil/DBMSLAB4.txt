The TRUNCATE statement in SQL is used to quickly and efficiently delete all rows from a table while preserving its structure. Unlike DELETE, 
TRUNCATE is faster because it does not log individual row deletions and cannot include a WHERE clause. It is typically used to reset a table for reuse.
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
[ADD column_definition | MODIFY column_definition | DROP COLUMN column_name | RENAME TO new_table_name];
